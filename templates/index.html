                                        <p>The goal of this research is to see if women with children work more if they have access to convenient subsidized transportation.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lead text-center">Participant Requirements</p>
                                        <p>In order to participate in this study, you need to meet the following requirements.
                                            <br> - You are at least 18 years of age and are you a mother?
                                            <br> - You have a child or children under the age of 18 who live with you and for whom you are that child or children’s parent or legal guardian.?
                                            <br> - You do not have regular access to a car.
                                            <br> - You have a smartphone.
                                            <br> - Your smartphone “data plan” allows you to send and receive data from the internet.
                                            <br> - You are seeking a job, interested in finding a better job, or hoping to work more hours.
                                            <br> - You have an existing Uber account and the Uber mobile app from Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”), or, if not, you are willing to download the Uber mobile app and sign up for an Uber account.
                                            <br> - You are willing to download a custom mobile app for this study.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lead text-center">Benefits</p>
                                        <p>We will provide participants with a number of free Uber trips that can be used anywhere within the Pittsburgh area over the 6 months of our study period. We will help you download and install a mobile app that we have developed for the study. This mobile app will include features that can help you find jobs, training, and low-cost child care, if you are interested. You will also need to be willing to download the Uber mobile app and create an Uber account, if you do not already have one. If you do not already have the Uber mobile app, we will also help you download and install the Uber mobile app.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Having access to Uber may be helpful to you if you are trying to travel to a job, job interview or job training. The access to information about job openings in the Pittsburgh area might be helpful to you if you are looking for a job. Besides, the knowledge received from this study may be of value to humanity.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Participants in the study are welcome to use the standard UberX service. However, participants will not be allowed to use our research funds for other Uber services like UberXL or UberPremium or for the Uber Eats service. Participants may, of course, use these services with their own funds.
                                            <br> </p>
                                        <p class="text-lead text-center">Compensation & Costs</p>
                                        <p>When you are first enrolled into our study, you will be given $30 worth of Uber trips to make sure that you can use the Uber system. Starting in the next calendar month, you can take up to $200 worth of Uber trips paid for by this research project every month for up to 6 months. You will also receive compensation of $10 for completing an initial survey and for each monthly survey you complete, for up to six months.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> This means you will be eligible to receive up to $1230 worth of Uber trips (charged to Carnegie Mellon’s corporate Uber account) and up to $70 in compensation (paid through gift cards or directly into your bank account) for completing surveys over the duration of the study. You can link your smartphone to your bank account, so that we can use an internet payment utility (Venmo) to transfer these funds directly to you, without requiring any bank account information.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> There will be no direct cost to you if you participate in this study. However, if you do not possess an unlimited data plan for your cell phone, some modest costs may be incurred through your use of our app. Please read the “Risks” section below carefully, and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lead text-center">Procedures</p>
                                        <p>We will help you download and install a mobile app that we have developed for the study. You will have to keep this mobile app installed and operating through the duration of the study. This mobile app will include features that can help you find jobs, training, and low-cost child care, if you are interested. You are not required to use these features.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> If you do not already have the Uber mobile app, we will also help you download and install the Uber mobile app if you have not done it before.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> You will need to provide us with your name and the email address you use (or will use) for your Uber account. We will need to supply your name and this email address to Uber in order for you to be able to take Uber trips paid for by our study. Once Uber receives your name and email information, Uber will email you an invitation to join Carnegie Mellon’s company account on Uber. If you have not already created an Uber account, you will need to create one at that time. Uber will need to use your name and email address to link your individual Uber account to Carnegie Mellon’s corporate Uber account so that you can choose to charge Uber trips to Carnegie Mellon’s account up to the maximum dollar amount of rides you are entitled to under the study at that time. Because Carnegie Mellon is using the “Uber for Business” corporate program for this study, it is possible that Uber’s enrollment materials could refer to Carnegie Mellon as “your company” or “your organization” even though you will not become part of Carnegie Mellon or have any employment status at Carnegie Mellon by participating in this study.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> During the first few days of your participation in our project, you will be provided with an initial allocation of $30 worth of Uber trips. This small initial allocation is provided so that you can make sure you can use the Uber service and are able to charge the rides to Carnegie Mellon’s corporate Uber account for the study.</p>
                                        <p>We will also send you a short survey on your employment activities, if any, prior to joining our study. This survey will ask you about your occupation, employer, hourly wage, and average hours per week. These data will be protected in the manner described below. You will receive $10 for completing this survey.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> At the beginning of the next calendar month, you will receive your first full allocation of $200 worth of Uber trips. These credits must be used during the calendar month in which they are received. The credits cannot “roll over” to the next month. This means that any part of the $200 credit you do not use in that month will expire at the end of the month. You will receive an additional allocation of $200 worth of Uber trips at the beginning of each of the remaining five months of the study. Each allocation must be used during the calendar month in which it is received.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> During the study period, we will push a brief survey to you through the smartphone app at the end of each month. You will be paid $10 for each monthly survey that you complete. Among other things, this survey will ask you about wages and hours worked. These data will be protected to ensure your privacy in the manner described below.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Every participant is expected to make truthful reports regarding the hours worked the previous month in the surveys she submits. We may use the GPS data collected in the manner described below to ensure that your movements as described by these data are consistent with your statements regarding hours worked. In cases where we identify large discrepancies, we may contact you for clarification.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> After the initial registration period, each participant will be in our study for up to 6 full months. Participants will therefore be eligible for a total maximum benefit of $1,230 worth of Uber trips (including your initial $30 trial allocation). If you submit a survey every month, you could earn an additional $60, provided in the form of gift cards or transfers to your bank account.</p>
                                        <p>When you use the Uber app to take rides and you elect to have those rides charged to Carnegie Mellon as allowed under this study, those rides are part of this study and Uber will share the following information about those rides with us for use in the study: pick-up address and time, drop-off address and time, trip route, duration, distance, fare amount, and trip ID. The ride information made available by Uber to Carnegie Mellon for the study also allows the user to note the purpose of the trip, but you are not required to do so. Uber may collect other information on you and your rides that they do not share with us. Your use of the Uber mobile app and any and all data collected by Uber through your use of the app or otherwise from you will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of your Uber account. Carnegie Mellon does not control Uber’s terms and conditions or how Uber uses the data that Uber collects from its account holders.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> We will partner with Allegheny County Department of Human Services (“DHS”) to study how participation in this study might affect the long-term well-being of participants and their families. DHS may already collect or have in its possession data about your family, your family’s use of social services, your family’s participation in training programs or entitlement programs, etc. Please note that DHS will not share this data with us. Instead, we will provide your name, email address, physical address, and phone number to DHS, and identify you as a member of our treatment group or control group, but we will not share any of the detailed GPS, survey, or Uber ride data we collect with DHS. DHS will use its data holdings to conduct statistical analysis on its own data for the purposes of determining the effect of participation in our study on the variables that DHS currently tracks. DHS may share the results of this statistical analysis with us, but DHS will not share individual data records with us. This means we will learn from DHS the average effect of participation on various participating groups, but we will never know the impact on particular individuals. These procedures will protect your privacy and the privacy of your family.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Part of our study will seek to track the impact of access to Uber on the mobility of participants. For that reason, our study app will track your GPS coordinates every 15 minutes throughout the duration of this study. However, these data will be protected and anonymized in the manner described below, so that researchers will not know your identity when they are analyzing the data.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Upon the end of the study (or your earlier request to withdraw or removal from the study) we will remove the ability for you to charge any more Uber trips to Carnegie Mellon’s corporate account and stop collecting your data from Uber, and we will stop collecting data from the study app. However, ending participation in the study will not remove the Uber app from your phone or terminate your Uber account, nor will it automatically remove the study app. It is up to you whether you want to keep the Uber app and to continue using Uber at your own expense.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lead text-center">Risks</p>
                                        <p>The risks involved in this study are minimal. You may experience slightly more (2-10%) battery usage on your phone, meaning you might need to charge your phone earlier in the day than your previous habit. Slightly more battery usage has not been a significant burden for participants in other studies using similar smartphone applications.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Because our study app will transmit data to the internet, you may experience more data usage than usual. Depending on your smartphone data plan, you may incur additional charges from your phone company associated with using our study app.  If you spend lots of time using the job search tool, this could lead to additional charges from your phone company.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> If you are unable to afford a data plan or maintain your cell phone service, please contact us. We may be able to provide extra resources to keep your phone connected, although we cannot guarantee this.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> The GPS data that we collect using our study app will be longitude and latitude data, and that in some cases will be enough information to tell us the actual buildings and specific locations you visit during the day. You may experience some worry about a loss of privacy as a result of revealing your location and daily activities during the study. However, the data do not tell us what you are doing, who you are with, nor where you are inside a building. We need to collect this information because we seek to understand how access to transportation resources – or information about job opportunities – affects where people go and when. To measure this effect accurately, we need to track your location data in a detailed, frequent manner. But we will do so in a way that protects your privacy.</p>
                                        <p>For research purposes, we may also track your usage of the job search tool we provide as part of this study. You are not required to use this tool, and your search for specific jobs will not be tracked in detail. These data will also be collected in a way that protects your privacy as described below.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> We will initially collect your GPS data, survey data, and data on your usage of our job search tool on a secure server, employing industry best practices to protect data. From Uber, we will also receive data on your use of Uber trips charged to our account. We will link the data from Uber with the other data we have collected, and store the combined data set on Carnegie Mellon University’s private network on a password protected site that can only be accessed by research team members. We will then anonymize the data, replacing your name, phone number, and all other personally identifying information with a randomly selected personal ID code. All statistical analysis performed by our research team will use these anonymized data. This protects your privacy, because our research team will not know whose data they are analyzing.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Of course, there is a potential, though unlikely, risk of loss of confidentiality associated with this study. However, we will follow recommended procedures to anonymize the data we collect in this study, as described above, and we will follow recommended procedures to guard against unauthorized data access or data breaches.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> It is possible that you may fail to un-install the study app at the end of your participation in our experiment. To avoid such a situation, we will explicitly give you instructions both at the beginning and the end of the experiment describing how to do the un-installation (it is the same as un-installing any usual app). We will also stop the location tracking from our server side after the experiment period ends or when you withdraw from the study; implementing this step tells the phone to stop transmitting, even if the app remains installed. This further protects your privacy, even before you un-install the app.</p>
